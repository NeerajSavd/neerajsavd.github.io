title: Objectify (Image Segmentation for Drones)
date: Sep 2024 - Mar 2025
Developed an image segmentation model using U-Net architecture with a ResNet34 encoder for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications.
Implemented transfer learning using PyTorch, achieving a mean IOU of 0.931 and a mean accuracy of 99.7%.
Optimized the model for real-time object detection and classification of aerial images at 5 images per second.
Enhanced model performance by introducing data augmentation, weighted cross-entropy loss, and learning rate optimization to reduce false positives and improve accuracy, resulting in a 25% increase in per-class accuracy.
Collaborated in a team of 4 to conduct research and train 10 versions of the model, documenting improvements.
